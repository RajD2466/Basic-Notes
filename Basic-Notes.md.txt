# Basic Notes on Programming Languages (Python & Java)

## 1. What is a Programming Language?
- A programming language is a set of instructions used to communicate with a computer.
- It helps us write code to solve problems, automate tasks, and build applications.

## 2. Python
- Type: High-level, interpreted, object-oriented.
- Easy to Learn: Simple syntax, similar to English.

**Features:**
- Dynamically typed (no need to declare variable type).
- Large library support (for AI, data science, web, etc.).
- Cross-platform (works on Windows, Mac, Linux).

**Uses:**
- Web Development (Django, Flask)
- Data Science, Machine Learning (Pandas, TensorFlow)
- Automation & Scripting

**Example Code:**
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## 3. Java
- Type: High-level, compiled + interpreted, object-oriented.
- Widely Used: Popular for enterprise, Android apps, backend systems.

**Features:**
- Statically typed (need to declare variable type).
- Platform-independent (via JVM â€“ Java Virtual Machine).
- Strong OOP support (classes, objects, inheritance, etc.).

**Uses:**
- Android App Development
- Enterprise Applications (Banking, ERP systems)
- Web Applications (Spring Framework)

**Example Code:**
```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## 4. Key Differences Between Python & Java

| Feature       | Python                          | Java                          |
|---------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Typing        | Dynamically typed               | Statically typed              |
| Speed         | Slower (interpreted)            | Faster (compiled to bytecode) |
| Syntax        | Simple, short, easy             | Verbose, more code needed     |
| Use Cases     | AI, Data Science, Automation    | Mobile apps, Enterprise apps  |

## 5. Conclusion
- Python is best for beginners, AI, and rapid development.
- Java is best for Android apps, enterprise solutions, and large-scale projects.
